# Audio-Downloader

I made this project mainly because I did't want to pay for 3rd party tools and I wanted to listen to Elon Musk interviews, speechs and etc... when I am out or offline.

Make sure you have Python 12 from Microsoft Store.
I am not sure if this would work on other versions of Python.
Be vary that you need to have "pytube" package downloaded. To download "pytube", follow this command in the project terminal- "pip install pytube"
Make sure you provide the right path when it asks you for it.
Let me know if you face any error and I will try to fix it.

NOTE: I have only tested this for youtube links, feel free to use this code and review a better version for it.
