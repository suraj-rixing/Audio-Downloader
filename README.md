# Audio-Downloader
Make sure you have Python 12 from Microsoft Store.
I am not sure if this would work on other versions of Python.
Be vary that you have "pytube" package downloaded. To download "pytube", follow this command in the project terminal- "pip install pytube"
Make sure you provide the right path when it asks you for it.
Let me know if you face any error and I will try to fix it.

NOTE: I have only tested this for youtube links and feel free to use this code.
